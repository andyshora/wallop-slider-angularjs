  This element groups all the items, but not the buttons
  It's a recommendation but it's very likely
  you'll want to hide any overflow from the items
  Especially when doing animations such as scale

  By default, they are all hidden and

  I recommend always having .Wallop-item--current

  All we do here, is make it visible again reset
  the position to static. Could also be relative
